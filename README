Pontarius is a work in progress to build a Haskell XMPP library that
implements the client capabilities of RFC 6120 ("XMPP Core").

The latest version, 1.0 Alpha 8, is the first release since the
project was put on ice in around July, as well as the first release by
Nejla. The new release primarily brings a new API, a rewritten Session
module, a new event system and updated code to unbreak Pontarius with
regards to new versions of dependencies (most notably the conduit and
xml-conduit packages). However, there are a number of features that
are (temporarily) missing from this rewrite of library, such as TLS
security and SASL authentication.

Overall, we are working on cleaning up the code, the final
architectural details and towards feature-completeness to be able to
move the project into beta.
