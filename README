Pontarius XMPP 0.1 aims to implement the client capabilities of RFC 6120 ("XMPP
Core"). We have recently released 0.1 Alpha 7, which may be the last version
that is not feature-complete. We will soon move the project into beta.

Please note that we are not recommending anyone to use Pontarius XMPP at this
time as itâ€™s still in an experimental stage and will have its API and data types
modified. However, if you are interested to use Pontarius XMPP anyway, feel free
to contact the Pontarius project and we will try to help you get started. Please
see http://www.pontarius.org/ for documentation and more information.

The next version is scheduled to be released on the 17th of August.

Look at the Pontarius web site <http://www.pontarius.org/> and the Pontarius
XMPP Hackage page <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pontarius-xmpp/> for more
information.
