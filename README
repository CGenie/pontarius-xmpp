Pontarius XMPP aims to be a secure and easy-to-use XMPP library for Haskell. We
have just released a sixth alpha version with the following features:

  * Client-to-server Transport Layer Security and DIGEST-MD5 SASL Authentication
  * Concurrent, Flexible and Event-based API for XMPP Client Developers
  * Support for Info/Query, Presence and Message Stanzas
  * Interoperable XML Parsing (Using enumerator, xml-enumerator and xml-types)

Please note that we are not recommending anyone to use Pontarius XMPP at this
time as itâ€™s still in an experimental stage and will have its API and data types
modified. However, if you are interested to use Pontarius XMPP anyway, feel free
to contact the Pontarius project and we will try to help you get started. Please
see http://www.pontarius.org/ for the user manual.

We are currently working on general improvements and having the library support
all of RFC 6120: XMPP Core.

The next version, 0.1 Alpha 7, is scheduled to be released on the 27th of July.

Look at the Pontarius web site <http://www.pontarius.org/> and the Pontarius
XMPP Hackage page <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pontarius-xmpp/> for more
information.
