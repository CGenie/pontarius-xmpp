-- connect is implemented using hookStreamOpenedEvent, hookTLSSecuredEvent, and
-- hookAuthenticatedEvent, and is offered as a convenience function for clients
-- that doesn't need to perform any XMPP actions in-between opening the streams
-- and TLS securing the stream and\/or authenticating, allowing them to listen
-- for and manage one event instead of up to three. Just-values in the third and
-- fourth parameters will make connect TLS secure the stream and authenticate,
-- respectively. Most clients will want to hook to the Connected event using
-- hookConnectedEvent prior to using this function.
--
-- The ConnectedEvent and StreamOpenedEvent are guaranteed to be generated upon
-- calling this function. So will a subset of the TLSSecuredEvent and
-- AuthenticatedEvent, depending on whether their functionalities are requested
-- using Just-values in the third and fourth parameters.
--
-- connect is designed with the assupmtion that openStreams, tlsSecure, and
-- authenticate will not be used by the client. Calling those functions may
-- generate events that can cause connect to behave incorrectly.
