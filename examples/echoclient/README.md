This directory defines a project that illustrates how to connect, authenticate,
set a simple presence, receive message stanzas, and echo them back to whoever is
sending them, using Pontarius XMPP.

The `Main.hs', `Setup.hs', and `echoclient.cabal' files in this directory may be
used freely, as they are in the public domain.
